## About

Hi! I am a software engineer trying to write some code and learn things.

See my [resum√©](https://bclarkx2.github.io/resume/resume.pdf) for more details
(along with the [source code](https://github.com/bclarkx2/resume) that generates
it!).

## Interests

I am a daily Linux user (Ubuntu), and take a perverse joy in breaking basic
components of my workflows and trying to figure out how to fix then improve
them.

Right now, I code mostly in Python, Go, and bash, although I have a long,
bittersweet history with Java as well.

Check out my
[.vimrc](https://github.com/bclarkx2/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/.vimrc) and tell
me what I am doing wrong! Converted from Sublime Text to vim a few years ago and
haven't looked back since. vscode can take a hike, I don't care how popular it
gets.

I love working on the back end of a system -- crafting perfect interfaces and
optimizing back end architecture makes me all tingly inside. I deeply appreciate
an intuitive, accessible UX -- particularly when it's somebody else's job to
make it!

Open source and data privacy is very important to me. Consider donating to the
EFF if you can: https://supporters.eff.org/donate/.

Very interested in learning more about functional programming and machine
learning.

## Projects

### Developer tools

These are some projects I like to work on to keep myself organized and efficient
while doing other work. Sometimes we can't avoid getting distracted from doing
real work by the temptation of improving a developer tool real quick!

* [bashful](https://github.com/bclarkx2/bashful)

### Linux configurations

Working on your Linux environment should feel like putting on an old glove. Gets
the job done just the way you like it, but also sometimes randomly gets a hole
torn in it and takes 6 hours to figure out how to sew it back up.
